  This is a placeholder paragraph of the 'City Intro Section' using the CMS from
  this website's admin panel. After receiving the email invitation, add '/admin'
  to this website's URL in the browser *(only email addresses that received the
  invitation can access the CMS). Log in with your own password that you choose.
  You will be redirected to the CMS. Do not select 'New Hero Section' as this
  will duplicate the section. Instead, just edit the current one as desired. All
  text and images on this website are configurable through the CMS.


  It is recommended to have the window of the live site open while in another window, using the CMS to better see what is being edited. After clicking 'Publish', allow about 2-3 minutes to view changes live.
